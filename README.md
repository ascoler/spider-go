🕷️ Spider-Go

A smart web crawler that automatically discovers and maps all links on websites.
What It Does

    Finds all links on web pages

    Processes multiple pages simultaneously for fast performance

    Stores everything in a database

    Automatically distributes tasks between workers

How It Works

    Give it a starting URL

    System reads the page and discovers all links

    New links get added to the processing queue

    Repeats for subsequent pages
Components

    Crawler Service (main.go) - Core crawling logic

    Queue Service (queue.go) - Manages URL processing queue

    Storage Service (Work_With_Db.go) - Handles database operations

    API Gateway (Api-Gateway.go) - REST API interface

    Build complete site maps

    Web content analysis

⚡ Quick Start

    Start all services:
    bash

go run Work_With_Db.go    # Storage service
go run queue.go           # Queue service  
go run main.go            # Crawler service
go run Api-Gateway.go     # API gateway

Send a request:
bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/Analysis_Link \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'

The system will crawl the website and return all discovered links and content.
